Vamp is the Very Awesome Microservices Platform. Vamp's core features are a platform-agnostic microservices DSL, easy A-B testing/canary releasing on everything and a deep and extendable metrics engine that monitors everything and directly feeds back into your services.

Vamp is open source and mostly written in Scala, with some
parts in Go.
