Vamp is actively developed by [Magnetic.io](http://magnetic.io) but is an open source project. 
We encourage anyone to pitch in with pull requests, issues etc.

Note: We are currently in alpha. This means the API will change, features will be added/removed and there will be bugs. Having said that:


*Vamp is split into separate repos and projects, just like actual microservices...* :metal:

1. [Vamp](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp) : the brains of the organization.
2. [Vamp UI](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui) : the Vamp UI.
3. [Vamp Gateway Agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent) : serves as an intermediary agent between supported config stores (ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul) and HAProxy, and routes HAProxy logs to Logstash.

*We accept bug reports and pull requests on the GitHub repo for each project*.

* If you have a question about how to use Vamp, please [check the Vamp documentation first](http://vamp.io/documentation/).

* If you have a change or new feature in mind, please [suggest it by creating an issue](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues) and tag it with "feature proposal"

Keep Vamping! :heart: 

The Vamp team
